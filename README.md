EcoTrack – Your Personal Carbon Companion

EcoTrack is a mobile app that helps users understand their daily environmental impact. It tracks eco-friendly actions like biking, walking, recycling, and eating vegetarian meals, then calculates how much CO₂ they save in pounds using a locally running Fetch.ai agent powered by ASI:One.

The app gamifies sustainability by showing streaks, stats, and leaderboards — turning small green habits into visible progress for the planet.
